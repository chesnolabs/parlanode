      "We count the number of unique words and the number of all words spoken in all speeches given by the MP. Then we count the number of times each unique word occurs. We divide words in categories according to the number of times they were repeated (once, twice, three times, etc.).",
      "In the end we calculate the coefficient. To calculate the coefficient we put the number of unique spoken words above the fraction bar, and the number of words which are repeated with some frequency (once, twice, three times...) multiplied with the square of the frequency (one squared, two squared, three squared...) below the fraction bar.",
