  title: Attendance at the National Assembly sessions
  info: >-
    # MP's attendance at the National Assembly sessions compared to the average
    and maximum value.


    We count all sessions and check whether the MP voted at least once during an
    individual session. If they voted at least once we count them as present at
    that specific session. We divide the number of sessions where the MP was
    present with the number of all sessions and normalise the number (min 1 -
    max 100).
