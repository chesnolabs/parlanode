For all other information we contacted the PR departments of parliamentary groups. We received information from NSi, SD, (then) ZaAB and ZL. SMC directed us to their web site and SDS directed us to the web site of the National Assembly. We collected the missing data using the Google search engine and gave all the parliamentary parties an opportunity to make corrections before publication."
