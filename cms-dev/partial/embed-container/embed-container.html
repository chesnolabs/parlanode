            <h1>This is a demo of how cards work.</h1>
            <p>They take up all the space given to them, we use Bootstrap's columns to limit them. There are effectively two types of cards. Those that take up half the container's width and those that go full. The halflings have a fixed height of: 640px.</p>
            <p>We have some tweaks such as negative margins on card-containers, as well as some limitations on Bootstrap's container. Apart from that, it's all vanilla Bootstrap around.</p>
